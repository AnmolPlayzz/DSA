# DSA Repository

This repo is for my DSA shit basically.

Nothing much more to it - just a collection of data structures and algorithms implementations.

## Special Features

There's a special script setup that automatically handles file inputs and outputs into respective txt files (`input.txt` and `output.txt`).

## Usage

Use the configured VS Code tasks to:
- Build active C++ file
- Run with automatic input/output redirection
